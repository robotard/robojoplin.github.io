Mes Amis, I understand that this may be scary for thee,
But I feel it a time apt to uncover the thoughts within me.

In so many ways, perhaps whilst writhing, you've offered such wealth an guidance,

For my various reasons, I've often been hiding, but behind it I'll apologise for avoidance.

This simple, yet complicated boy, left so confused, just needs his angels, and no need to puruse, his goal always to never abuse.

Yet just to be there. I don't want to confuse. This little annoying boy will not refreut, I've been a pain in the ass, and that's for sure, barely offering and baring a fruit(ious) retreat.

So with many apologies I open up this folder to thee, so tremendously important for so long just to me.

Please keep those wonderful eyes upon all this weirdly; I write these prose merely understandingly

They explain the weirdo that I continue to be, there'll be moment I'll write emphatically.

However my feelings, disposing of history, I'll try to still write a little poetry, perhaps just a little note just about me.

-I love you all x
